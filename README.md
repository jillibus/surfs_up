## Overview

After my vacation to Hawaii, I decided my goal in life was to open a Surf n' Shake Shop on the island of Oahu.  I quickly wrote up a solid business plan and searched for an investor.  I chose W. Avy, who is famous for his love of surfing.  He is excited to invest in my Surf n' Shake Shop, as long I do due diligence on the weather and temperature on the island of Oahu, as he attempted this early in his career, and where he set his surf shop up at, it rained constantly and his shop failed. I set out to see if the island of Oahu would be a good choice for my Surf n' Shake Shop.

* Since I have been interested in Data Analytics I pressed forward in analyizing the Weather details of Oahu for the past year, specificially in the areas of temperature and rainfall.
* W. Avy provided me with data in the form of a sqlite database of hawaii weather data, and I will be using this to prepare the analysis.
* The tools I will be using will be Python, Pandas, sqlite, SQLAlchemy as well as Mathplotlib so I can display the statistics in a more user friendly manor.

## Resources
* Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite
* Software: Python 3.7.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, sqlAlchemy, sqlite
